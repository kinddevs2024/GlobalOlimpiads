## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=780692716304-p2k6rmk2gtlrhrrf1ltncl986b1hqgrf.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Note:** The Google Client ID is already configured in `src/utils/constants.js` as a fallback, but you can override it using the environment variable above.

**Important for Backend:** The Google Client Secret (`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`) should be configured on your backend server only, not in the frontend. The backend needs it to verify Google access tokens.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Troubleshooting

If `vite` command is not found:

- Make sure you've run `npm install` in the frontend directory
- The package.json now uses `npx vite` which should work even if vite isn't in PATH
- Try running `npm run dev` from the frontend directory
